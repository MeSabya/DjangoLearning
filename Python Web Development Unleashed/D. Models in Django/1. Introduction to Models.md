# Introduction to Models

An essential part of any website is the ability to accept information from a user, input it into a database, retrieve information from a database, and use the retrieved information to generate content for the user. We can use Models to incorporate a database into a Django Project.

Models define the structure of the data stored in a database, including the field types, possibly their maximum size or default values, etc. A Model in Django is a python class that generally maps to a single database table. Django already comes equipped with SQLite. So, we will be using SQLite for our examples in this course. However, Django can also connect to a variety of other SQL engine backends, including PostgreSQL and MySQL.

## Using a different backend
In the settings.py file, we can edit the ENGINE parameter used for DATABASES. That is where we would connect to a different backend, if we didn’t want to use SQLite.

## Creating a Model
To create a Model, we use a class structure inside of the relevant application’s models.py file that already exists in our application’s directory, but that we haven’t yet written any code in.

This class object will be a subclass of Django’s built-in class:

```python
django.db.models.Model 
```
We will inherit from this built-in Model class.

With a bit of Django magic, each Model class will be directly translated into an SQL table. We will not have to manipulate the SQL directly. Each attribute of the Model class will represent a column in the SQL table.

## The model fields have specific types such as:

CharField
BooleanField
DateField

## Relationships between Models
We already know that SQL is a relational database, therefore, the tables can refer to each other. To depict the relationships between tables, we use Foreign keys and Primary keys.

A primary key in a model is represented by using the primary_key option.

A foreign key in a model is represented by the field type ForeignKey.
