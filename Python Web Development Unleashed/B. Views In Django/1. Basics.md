 A view function is a Python function that takes a Web request and returns a Web response. This response can be the HTML contents of a Web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, or an image, anything that a web browser can display. 
 
 ## Types of Views

Django views are divided into two major categories:-

- Function-Based Views
- Class-Based Views

## Function Based Views
Function based views are writer using a function in python which receives as an argument HttpRequest object and returns an HttpResponse Object. Function based views are generally divided into 4 basic strategies, i.e., CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete). CRUD is the base of any framework one is using for development. 

## Class Based Views
Class-based views provide an alternative way to implement views as Python objects instead of functions. They do not replace function-based views, but have certain differences and advantages when compared to function-based views: 

- Organization of code related to specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) can be addressed by separate methods instead of conditional branching.
- Object oriented techniques such as mixins (multiple inheritance) can be used to factor code into reusable components.

Class-based views are simpler and efficient to manage than function-based views. A function-based view with tons of lines of code can be converted into class-based views with few lines only.
