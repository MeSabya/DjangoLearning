## What is a RESTful API?

For a system to be "RESTful" -- i.e., compliant with REST -- it needs to abide by some rules:

- Separation of Concerns: The client and server are separated
- Stateless: Each request from the client to the server is stateless. In other words, both the client and server can understand any request independently, without seeing any of the previous requests.
- Uniformed Interface: All API endpoints should be accessible by the same approach.
